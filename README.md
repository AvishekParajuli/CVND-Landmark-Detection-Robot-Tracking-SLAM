#CVND:Landmark Detection & Robot Tracking (SLAM)

This repository contains the personal project submission as a part of CVND Nanodegree project. In this project we use robot sensor measurements and movement to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot, over time.It utilizes SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) techniques to create a 2 dimensional world map in this project.
